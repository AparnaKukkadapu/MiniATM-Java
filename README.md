# Mini ATM Project (Java)

Description

This is a simple Java console-based project that simulates a Mini ATM machine.
It is designed to demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic user input handling in Java.

The project provides four basic options:

1. Check Balance – Displays the current account balance.
2. Deposit Amount – Adds money to the balance.
3. Withdraw Amount – Deducts money from the balance (only if sufficient balance is available)..
4. Exit – Ends the program.

🔴 Invalid selections show the error message:
"Enter a valid number"

✅ Additional checks handle invalid deposits or withdrawals.

Concepts Practiced

Loops (a while loop to keep showing the menu until exit)
Conditional Statements (if-else for option handling and validations)
Switch-case (for menu-driven program structure)
User input handling with Scanner (to match other points).
Basic Arithmetic Operations
